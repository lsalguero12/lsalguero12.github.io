### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

Lab 3 was one of my favorite labs as it was the very first lab where we were introduced to use "make" instead of clang++. In this lab is where i started to see more of the Computer Science field and the extenses it could reach.

* Lab 4

In Lab 4, part 1 was something that stood out for me as we had to modify not just one repository but instead we had to code in multiple repositories and include them all into the main repository. For this part of the lab we had to start using math to convert different types of measures used in the kitchen mostly.

* Lab 7

Lab 7 was definitely one of the most complicated personally, part 2 was a little tough as we had to write a code to input the street, day, hour, and minute someone wanted to park. We had to give the output to see if it was okay for people to park on each individual street at a certain time.
